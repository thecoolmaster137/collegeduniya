                The exam qualifies candidates for admission in various
                prestigious engineering colleges across India. Previously known
                as IIT-JEE, it was renamed in 2013 and since then, it has been
                administered and regulated by the seven branches of IITs
                (Roorkee, Kharagpur, Delhi, Bombay, Kanpur, Madras and
                Guwahati). It consists of two papers with questions drawn from
                Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics and a Architecture Aptitude Test
                (AAT) for candidates aspiring to enroll in an architecture
                course
